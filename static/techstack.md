Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/sanjananatraj/thirdwavecoffeebase).

This project was built with custom web scraping scripts using the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library with [Python](https://www.python.org/). The results were then inputted in a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) relational database. The routing and backend of the API was created using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

The frontend is generated with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/), specifically with the [docsify-darklight-theme](https://docsify-darklight-theme.boopathikumar.me/#/). 

This project is hosted using GCP (Google Cloud Platform), specifically Google Cloud SQL and Google App Engine.
